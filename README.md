Ensembling ML Models to Classify Breast Tumors

This project aims to develop predictive models for breast cancer diagnosis using machine learning techniques. The dataset utilized for this analysis is sourced from the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset available on Kaggle. The dataset contains various features computed from breast mass samples, enabling the classification of tumors as benign or malignant.
